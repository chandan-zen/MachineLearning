# Purpose : To predict, analyse and provide the counter measures to prevent the Spamming. 
         - Build a Model to predict the Spam Messages' likely to be churned using Data Science, NLP and Machine Learning Applications.

# Use: 
This model will be able to predict the Churning of Customers and prevent it from happening with Utmost Accuracy. This will be majorly useful in Telecom firms, E-Commerce industry and basically every industry as such.

# Business Understanding: 
The data used to build a Customer Churn Prediction Model, consists of data related Telecom domain, and their behavioral trends w.r.t. Churning across 4 years of time span. 

# Work Flow :
> Extracted the data from Kaggle open source.
> Performed Data Exploration to understand the descriptive stats  w.r.t. the data, in order to manipulate the data to build a robust ML model.
> Used Pandas, matplotlib &  Numpy for Data Pre-processing, to decrease the redundancy, by taking care of the duplicates.
  - Data consisted of 0% Missing Values.
> EDA& Vizualized the Data using Seaborn & Matplolib to understand the data || Used Un-Masking to find messages with max & min length of words.
  - Used Box-Plot method to detect and handle the Outliers.
> Performed Text-Preprocessing using NLP-NLTK Lib. : Used Bag Of Word/ Tokenization / Count-Vectorization to analyse the text and make it ready for ML modelling.
> Trained the model using Sci-Kit Learn's , using Multinominal NB CLassifier.
  - Created a Data pipeline to automate the ML Workflow.
  - Created a model with 97% Accuracy
