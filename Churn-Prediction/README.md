# Churn-Prediction 

## Over-View

Build an *End-to-End Data Science Project* to predict customer churn for Telecom industry and provide prescriptive counter measures.
Performed Data Collection and pre-processing using Numpy, matplotlib and Pandas.
Utilized *SMOTE+ENN* to handle the Imbalanced Dataset 
Used RandomForest Classifier tuned its Hyper Parameter using *RandomizedSearchCV*.

In this repository, we have performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis, and idenfitied the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn, and I have used them wisely to create a model, and lately, have deployed the model.

### 🟢 For EDA, please refer to : Churn Analysis - EDA.ipynb
### 🟢 For Model Building, please refer to: Churn Analysis - Model Building.ipynb
### 🟢 For Model Deployment, please refer to app.py


### 🔵 Creating the flask API

```
app = Flask("__name__")
```

The loadPage method calls our home.html.
```
@app.route("/")
def loadPage():
	return render_template('home.html', query="")
```

The predict method is our POST method, which is basically called when we pass all the inputs from our front end and click SUBMIT.
```
@app.route("/", methods=['POST'])
def predict():
```
  
The run() method of Flask class runs the application on the local development server.
```
app.run()
```


Yay, our model is ready, let’s test our bot.
The above given Python script is executed from Python shell.

Go to Anaconda Prompt, and run the below query.
```
python app.py
```
### APP : [file:///C:/Users/jay.guwalani/Desktop/home.html]

Below message in Python shell is seen, which indicates that our App is now hosted at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or localhost:5000
```
